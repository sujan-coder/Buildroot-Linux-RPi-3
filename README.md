# Buildroot-Linux-for-Raspberry-Pi-3
This repository documents my process of building a minimal Linux image for Raspberry Pi 3 using **Buildroot**.  
The goal is to understand Linux system components like BusyBox, rootfs, and bootloaders through hands-on experimentation.

##Build Instructions
'''bash
git clone --recursive
